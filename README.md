# 42 Common Core

Welcome to my **42 Common Core** repository! This repository contains the projects and code I developed as part of the 42 Schoolâ€™s Common Core program.

## About 42 Common Core

The 42 Common Core is the foundational program of the 42 coding school, which offers a unique, tuition-free approach to computer science education. Unlike traditional education models, 42 has no formal teachers or classes. Instead, students learn through a peer-to-peer and project-based methodology, working on increasingly challenging projects to develop essential programming skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities.

The Common Core curriculum focuses on building a strong foundation in programming and computer science concepts. It emphasizes hands-on learning, encouraging students to collaborate with peers, manage their own learning process, and continuously push their limits.

## Key Concepts Covered

Throughout the Common Core, students tackle projects in areas such as:

- **C Programming**: Mastering low-level programming, memory management, and algorithms in the C language.
- **Shell Scripting**: Learning to work effectively in Unix-like environments and automate tasks with shell scripts.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Understanding and implementing common data structures and algorithms.
- **Problem Solving**: Developing analytical skills to tackle and solve complex problems independently.
- **Version Control**: Using Git to manage code, track changes, and collaborate with peers.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a project or exercise completed during the Common Core program. Projects are organized chronologically, demonstrating my progression through the curriculum. Each project folder contains:

- **Source Code**: The code files developed for the project.
- **Documentation**: Any additional notes or documentation related to the project.
- **Makefiles** (where applicable): Build automation scripts to compile projects.

## Highlights

Some of the most significant projects in the 42 Common Core include:

- **Libft**: Creating a custom library of essential C functions.
- **Get Next Line**: Implementing a function to read lines from a file descriptor.
- **Printf**: Developing a simplified version of the `printf` function.
- **Born2beroot**: Setting up and configuring a virtual server with strong security practices.
- **MiniTalk**: Learning about inter-process communication by sending messages between processes.
